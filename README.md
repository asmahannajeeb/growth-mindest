My name is Asmahan Najeeb , i'm 25 years old ' i'm a teacher ...
I really want to be a developer even though it's not esy to be ...
but with hard work and ambition everything will be easy ...



I have confident of myself which is relly important to achieve my goals ...
people who didn't have confidence will have a hard time and maybe they will fail ...
so self confidence is a very important thing to achieve goals ...




I can learn very quickly which is help me in this program and any other thing in my life ...
I can communicate with people easily even though I work with tough people ...
I already have skills on programming , all I need is to improve myself ...
